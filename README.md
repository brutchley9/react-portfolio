# React Portfolio

The world of front-end web development is inherently forward-thinking and constantly evolving. Learning new technologies, languages, and tricks of the trade is paramount to understanding this ever-evolving field, and for this purpose, I have built upon previous understanding of MVC webpage structure, as well as database management, to implement an updated porfolio to showcase just a few of my recent works, as well as a demonstration of my recent segway into the world of REACT web development. Take a moment to check out each page and follow the links provided!

To spin up this app locally, run an npm install for all dependencies included within package.json file, then run command "npm run dev". Webpage will be accessible at localhost:3007, and will load automatically.
